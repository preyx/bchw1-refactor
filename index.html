        <p>
          The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching
          for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at
          home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your
          visibility and find the right customers for your business.

        <p>
          The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social
          media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they
          want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the
          control over what potential customers see when they search for your
          business.

        <p>
          Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits.
          Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited
          to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase
          your lead generation.

        business, bringing customers directly to your website.

        Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing

      <h3>Cost Management</h3>
      <img src="./assets/images/cost-management.png" alt="Cost Management" />
      <p>
        As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising
        costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.
